I was invited by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia">Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association</a> to write a letter in response to my previous MMRAG paper. Now the letter is available: "<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jamia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jamia/ocaf237/8484185">Letter to the Editor in response to “Optimizing example-selection in retrieval-augmented biomedical in-context learning: reflections on the MMRAG study”</a>".
